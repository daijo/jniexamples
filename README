This directory and its subdirectories contain the example code for:

    The Java Native Interface: Programmer's Guide and Specification
    Sheng Liang, Addison-Wesley, 1999

Each subdirectory contains the examples for the corresponding chapter.
You can build and run all examples at once, or visit the subdirectories 
to build and run individual examples.

On Solaris:

1. In makeincludes.solaris, set the make variable JDK to point to your
   Java 2 SDK installation.
2. Type: make -f makefile.solaris
3. To clean up all build targets, type: make -f makefile.solaris clean

On Win32:

1. In makeincludes.win32, set the make variable JDK to point to your
   Java 2 SDK installation.
2. Type: nmake -f makefile.win32
3. To clean up all build targets, type: nmake -f makefile.win32 clean

README files in subdirectories list the page numbers where the
example code is discussed in the book.

A NOTE ON COMPILING THE EXAMPLES ON WIN32

You can also compile these examples by typing the commands as described
in the book. However, the Win32 compiler command lines given on pages 
16 and 87 of the book have an error. The error prevents the native
library or native application from being linked against msvcrt.dll, the
multithreaded C runtime library used by the virtual machine implementation
in JDK 1.1 and Java 2 SDK 1.2.

On page 16, the correct command line for building the HelloWorld example 
should be:

  cl -Ic:\jdk1.2.1\include -Ic:\jdk1.2.1\include\win32 -MD -LD HelloWorld.c -FeHelloWorld.dll

The original text in the book lacks the -MD option, causing the
native library to link with the single threaded C runtime library 
statically, instead of linking against msvcrt.dll dynamically.

On page 87, the correct command line for building invoke.c with
JDK 1.1 should be:

  cl -Ic:\jdk1.1.8\include -Ic:\jdk1.1.8\include\win32 -MD invoke.c -link c:\jdk1.1.8\lib\javai.lib

The original text in the book incorrectly uses the -MT option instead of
the -MD option, causing the native library to link with the multithreaded
C runtime library statically, instead of linking against msvcrt.dll
dynamically.
